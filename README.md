# Usage
For an interactive demo, run the interactive.py file. Note: When entering gaussian integers, they must always be of the form x+yi or x-yi. Ex. 5+0i, 0-6i, 6 + 7i, 10-20i, etc.

# Testing
Assuming you have python3 installed, you can test this code by navigating to this folder in your favorite terminal/commandline, and running the command:  
`python3 tests.py --verbose`  
This normally should take 0-5 seconds to run, and at most 10 seconds. All test cases are stored in the tests.py file. 

# Extended Euclidean Algorithm
Implements the extended euclidean algorithm in Python for integers, gausian integers Z[i], and Eisenstein integers Z[omega]. 

Sections:

## General Euclidean Algorithm
This part will give an explanation of how the extended euclidean algorithm works, and talk about how it works the same with multiple types of objects.

## Definitions Z, Z[i], Z[omega] and their representations in Python
Talks about how all 3 were represented in Python, with emphasis on them all inheriting div/mod operations.

## Misc.
Not sure what else quite yet.
