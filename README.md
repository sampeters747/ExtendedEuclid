# Extended Euclidean Algorithm
Implements the extended euclidean algorithm in Python for integers, gausian integers Z[i], and Eisenstein integers Z[omega]. 

Sections:

## General Euclidean Algorithm
This part will give an explanation of how the extended euclidean algorithm works, and talk about how it works the same with multiple types of objects.

## Representations of Z, Z[i], Z[omega] in Python
Talks about how all 3 were represented in Python, with emphasis on them all inheriting div/mod operations.

## Misc.
Not sure what else quite yet.
